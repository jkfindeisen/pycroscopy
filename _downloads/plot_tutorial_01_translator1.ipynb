Data and file formats\n    * Why you should care about data formats\n    * Current state of data formats in microscopy\n    * Structuring data in pycroscopy\n\n2. HDF5 file format\n\n\nIntroduction to Data Translation\n================================\n\nBefore any data analysis, we need to access data stored in the raw file(s) generated by the microscope. Often, the\ndata and parameters in these files are **not** straightforward to access. In certain cases, additional / dedicated\nsoftware packages are necessary to access the data while in many other cases, it is possible to extract the necessary\ninformation from built-in **numpy** or similar python packages included with **anaconda**.\n\nPycroscopy aims to make data access, storage, curation, etc. simply by storing the data along with all\nrelevant parameters in a single **.hdf5** or **.h5** file.\n\nThe process of copying data from the original format to **pycroscopy compatible hdf5 files** is called\n**Translation** and the classes available in pycroscopy that perform these operation are called **Translators**\n\n\nWriting Your First Data Translator\n==================================\n\n**The goal in this section is to trandslate the .asc file obtained from an Omicron microscope into a pycroscopy\ncompatible .h5 file.**\n\nWhile there is an **AscTranslator** avialable in pycroscopy that can translate these files in just a **single** line,\nwe will intentionally assume that no such translator is avialable. Using a handful of useful functions in pycroscopy,\nwe will translate the files from the source **.asc** format to the pycroscopy compatible **.h5** in just a few lines.\nThe code developed below is essentially the **AscTranslator**. The same methodology can be used to translate other data\nformats\n\n\nSetting up the notebook\n=======================\n\nThere are a few setup procedures that need to be followed before any code is written. In this step, we simply load a\nfew python packages that will be necessary in the later steps.\n\n\n\n"

Also, they\ncontain parameters in the first 403 lines and then contain data which is arranged as one pixel per row.\nSTS experiments result in 3 dimensional datasets (X, Y, current). In other words, a 1D array of current data (as a\nfunction of excitation bias) is sampled at every location on a two dimensional grid of points on the sample.\nBy knowing where the parameters are located and how the data is structured, it is possible to extract the necessary\ninformation from these files.\nSince we know that the data sizes (<200 MB) are much smaller than the physical memory of most computers, we can start\nby safely loading the contents of the entire file to memory\n\n"

        "Notes on pycroscopy translation\n===============================\n* Steps 1-3 would be performed anyway in order to begin data analysis\n* The actual pycroscopy translation step are reduced to just 3-4 lines in step 4.\n* A modular / formal version of this translator has been implemented as a class in pycroscopy as the AscTranslator\n  found at: https://github.com/pycroscopy/pycroscopy/blob/master/pycroscopy/io/translators/omicron_asc.py .\n  This custom translator packages the same code used above into functions that focus on the individual tasks such\n  as extracting parameters, reading data, and writing to h5. Once the necessary pieces (parameters, data) are gathered,\n  the h5 file can be written very easily using pycroscopy.io.Translator 's .simple_write() function. \n  The NumpyTranslator used above uses the very same .simple_write() function underneath to write its data as well.\n* There are many benefits to writing such a formal Translator class instead of standalone scripts like this including:\n\n  * Unlike such a stand-alone script, a Translator class in the package can be used by everyone repeatedly\n  * The custom Translator class can ensure consistency when translating multiple files. \n  * A single, robust Translator class can handle the finer variations / modes in the data. See the IgorIBWTranslator\n    as an example - https://github.com/pycroscopy/pycroscopy/blob/master/pycroscopy/io/translators/igor_ibw.py.\n\n* While this approach is feasible and encouraged for simple and small data, it may be necessary to use lower level\n  calls to write efficient translators. As an example, please see the BEPSndfTranslator at:\n  https://github.com/pycroscopy/pycroscopy/blob/master/pycroscopy/io/translators/beps_ndf.py\n* We have found python packages online to open a few proprietary file formats and have written translators using these\n  packages. If you are having trouble reading the data in your files and cannot find any packages online, consider \n  contacting the manufacturer of the instrument which generated the data in the proprietary format for help.\n\nVerifying the newly written H5 file:\n====================================\n* We will only perform some simple and quick verification to show that the data has indeed been translated corectly.\n* Please see the next notebook in the example series to learn more about reading and accessing data.\n\n"
