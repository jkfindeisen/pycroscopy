Tutorial 1: Data Translation
======================================================================================

This set of tutorials will serve as examples for developing end-to-end workflows for and using pycroscopy.

**In this example, we extract data and parameters from a Scanning Tunnelling Spectroscopy (STS) raw data file, as
obtained from an Omicron STM, and write these to a pycroscopy compatible data file.**


Prerequisites:
==============

Before proceeding with this example series, we recommend reading the previous documents to learn more about:

1. Data and file formats
    * Why you should care about data formats
    * Current state of data formats in microscopy
    * Structuring data in pycroscopy

2. HDF5 file format


Introduction to Data Translation
================================

Before any data analysis, we need to access data stored in the raw file(s) generated by the microscope. Often, the
data and parameters in these files are **not** straightforward to access. In certain cases, additional / dedicated
software packages are necessary to access the data while in many other cases, it is possible to extract the necessary
information from built-in **numpy** or similar python packages included with **anaconda**.

Pycroscopy aims to make data access, storage, curation, etc. simply by storing the data along with all
relevant parameters in a single **.hdf5** or **.h5** file.

The process of copying data from the original format to **pycroscopy compatible hdf5 files** is called
**Translation** and the classes available in pycroscopy that perform these operation are called **Translators**


Writing Your First Data Translator
==================================

**The goal in this section is to trandslate the .asc file obtained from an Omicron microscope into a pycroscopy
compatible .h5 file.**

While there is an **AscTranslator** avialable in pycroscopy that can translate these files in just a **single** line,
we will intentionally assume that no such translator is avialable. Using a handful of useful functions in pycroscopy,
we will translate the files from the source **.asc** format to the pycroscopy compatible **.h5** in just a few lines.
The code developed below is essentially the **AscTranslator**. The same methodology can be used to translate other data
formats


Setting up the notebook
=======================

There are a few setup procedures that need to be followed before any code is written. In this step, we simply load a
few python packages that will be necessary in the later steps.

# Ensure python 3 compatibility:
from __future__ import division, print_function, absolute_import, unicode_literals

# The package for accessing files in directories, etc.:
import os

# Warning package in case something goes wrong
from warnings import warn

# Package for downloading online files:
try:
    # This package is not part of anaconda and may need to be installed.
    import wget
except ImportError:
    warn('wget not found.  Will install with pip.')
    import pip
    pip.main(['install', 'wget'])
    import wget

# The mathematical computation package:
import numpy as np

# The package used for creating and manipulating HDF5 files:
import h5py

# Packages for plotting:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Finally import pycroscopy for certain scientific analysis:
try:
    import pycroscopy as px
except ImportError:
    warn('pycroscopy not found.  Will install with pip.')
    import pip
    pip.main(['install', 'pycroscopy'])
    import pycroscopy as px

# 0. Select the Raw Data file
# ===========================
# Download the data file from Github:
url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pycroscopy/pycroscopy/master/data/STS.asc'
data_file_path = 'temp_1.asc'
if os.path.exists(data_file_path):
    os.remove(data_file_path)
_ = wget.download(url, data_file_path, bar=None)

####################################################################################
# 1. Exploring the Raw Data File
# ==============================
#
# Inherently, one may not know how to read these **.asc** files. One option is to try and read the file as a text file
# one line at a time.
#
# It turns out that these .asc files are effectively the standard **ASCII** text files.
#
# Here is how we tested to see if the **asc** files could be interpreted as text files. Below, we read just thefirst 10
# lines in the file

with open(data_file_path, 'r') as file_handle:
    for lin_ind in range(10):
        print(file_handle.readline())

####################################################################################
# 2. Loading the data
# ===================
# Now that we know that these files are simple text files, we can manually go through the file to find out which lines
# are important, at what lines the data starts etc.
# Manual investigation of such .asc files revealed that these files are always formatted in the same way. Also, they
# contain parameters in the first 403 lines and then contain data which is arranged as one pixel per row.
# STS experiments result in 3 dimensional datasets (X, Y, current). In other words, a 1D array of current data (as a
# function of excitation bias) is sampled at every location on a two dimensional grid of points on the sample.
# By knowing where the parameters are located and how the data is structured, it is possible to extract the necessary
# information from these files.
# Since we know that the data sizes (<200 MB) are much smaller than the physical memory of most computers, we can start
# by safely loading the contents of the entire file to memory

# Extracting the raw data into memory
file_handle = open(data_file_path, 'r')
string_lines = file_handle.readlines()
file_handle.close()

####################################################################################
# 3. Read the parameters
# ======================
# The parameters in these files are present in the first few lines of the file

# Reading parameters stored in the first few rows of the file
parm_dict = dict()
for line in string_lines[3:17]:
    line = line.replace('# ', '')
    line = line.replace('\n', '')
    temp = line.split('=')
    test = temp[1].strip()
    try:
        test = float(test)
        # convert those values that should be integers:
        if test % 1 == 0:
            test = int(test)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    parm_dict[temp[0].strip()] = test

# Print out the parameters extracted
for key in parm_dict.keys():
    print(key, ':\t', parm_dict[key])

####################################################################################
# 3.a Prepare to read the data
# ============================
# Before we read the data, we need to make an empty array to store all this data. In order to do this, we need to read
# the dictionary of parameters we made in step 2 and extract necessary quantities

num_rows = int(parm_dict['y-pixels'])
num_cols = int(parm_dict['x-pixels'])
num_pos = num_rows * num_cols
spectra_length = int(parm_dict['z-points'])

####################################################################################
# 3.b Read the data
# =================
# Data is present after the first 403 lines of parameters.

# num_headers = len(string_lines) - num_pos
num_headers = 403

# Extract the STS data from subsequent lines
raw_data_2d = np.zeros(shape=(num_pos, spectra_length), dtype=np.float32)
for line_ind in range(num_pos):
    this_line = string_lines[num_headers + line_ind]
    string_spectrum = this_line.split('\t')[:-1]  # omitting the new line
    raw_data_2d[line_ind] = np.array(string_spectrum, dtype=np.float32)

####################################################################################
# 4.a Preparing some necessary parameters
# =======================================

max_v = 1 # This is the one parameter we are not sure about

folder_path, file_name = os.path.split(data_file_path)
file_name = file_name[:-4] + '_'

# Generate the x / voltage / spectroscopic axis:
volt_vec = np.linspace(-1 * max_v, 1 * max_v, spectra_length)

h5_path = os.path.join(folder_path, file_name + '.h5')

####################################################################################
# 4b. Calling the NumpyTranslator to create the pycroscopy data file
# ==================================================================
# The NumpyTranslator simplifies the ceation of pycroscopy compatible datasets. It handles the file creation,
# dataset creation and writing, creation of ancillary datasets, datagroup creation, writing parameters, linking
# ancillary datasets to the main dataset etc. With a single call to the NumpyTranslator, we complete the translation
# process.

tran = px.io.NumpyTranslator()
h5_path = tran.translate(h5_path, raw_data_2d, num_rows, num_cols,
                         qty_name='Current', data_unit='nA', spec_name='Bias',
                         spec_unit='V', spec_val=volt_vec, scan_height=100,
                         scan_width=200, spatial_unit='nm', data_type='STS',
                         translator_name='ASC', parms_dict=parm_dict)

# Notes on pycroscopy translation
# ===============================
# * Steps 1-3 would be performed anyway in order to begin data analysis
# * The actual pycroscopy translation step are reduced to just 3-4 lines in step 4.
# * A modular / formal version of this translator has been implemented as a class in pycroscopy as the AscTranslator
#   found at: https://github.com/pycroscopy/pycroscopy/blob/master/pycroscopy/io/translators/omicron_asc.py .
#   This custom translator packages the same code used above into functions that focus on the individual tasks such
#   as extracting parameters, reading data, and writing to h5. Once the necessary pieces (parameters, data) are gathered,
#   the h5 file can be written very easily using pycroscopy.io.Translator 's .simple_write() function. 
#   The NumpyTranslator used above uses the very same .simple_write() function underneath to write its data as well.
# * There are many benefits to writing such a formal Translator class instead of standalone scripts like this including:
#
#   * Unlike such a stand-alone script, a Translator class in the package can be used by everyone repeatedly
#   * The custom Translator class can ensure consistency when translating multiple files. 
#   * A single, robust Translator class can handle the finer variations / modes in the data. See the IgorIBWTranslator
#     as an example - https://github.com/pycroscopy/pycroscopy/blob/master/pycroscopy/io/translators/igor_ibw.py.
#
# * While this approach is feasible and encouraged for simple and small data, it may be necessary to use lower level
#   calls to write efficient translators. As an example, please see the BEPSndfTranslator at:
#   https://github.com/pycroscopy/pycroscopy/blob/master/pycroscopy/io/translators/beps_ndf.py
# * We have found python packages online to open a few proprietary file formats and have written translators using these
#   packages. If you are having trouble reading the data in your files and cannot find any packages online, consider 
#   contacting the manufacturer of the instrument which generated the data in the proprietary format for help.
#
# Verifying the newly written H5 file:
# ====================================
# * We will only perform some simple and quick verification to show that the data has indeed been translated corectly.
# * Please see the next notebook in the example series to learn more about reading and accessing data.

with h5py.File(h5_path, mode='r') as h5_file:
    # See if a tree has been created within the hdf5 file:
    px.hdf_utils.print_tree(h5_file)

    h5_main = h5_file['Measurement_000/Channel_000/Raw_Data']
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(ncols=2, figsize=(11, 5))
    spat_map = np.reshape(h5_main[:, 100], (100, 100))
    px.plot_utils.plot_map(axes[0], spat_map, origin='lower')
    axes[0].set_title('Spatial map')
    axes[0].set_xlabel('X')
    axes[0].set_ylabel('Y')
    axes[1].plot(np.linspace(-1.0, 1.0, h5_main.shape[1]),
                 h5_main[250])
    axes[1].set_title('IV curve at a single pixel')
    axes[1].set_xlabel('Tip bias [V]')
    axes[1].set_ylabel('Current [nA]')

# Remove both the original and translated files:
os.remove(h5_path)
os.remove(data_file_path)
