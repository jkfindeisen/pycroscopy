Getting Started
---------------
* Follow `these instructions <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/install.html>`_ to install pycroscopy
* See how we use pycroscopy for our scientific research in these `jupyter notebooks <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pycroscopy/pycroscopy/tree/master/jupyter_notebooks/>`_. Many of them are linked to journal publications listed below.
	* Please see the official `jupyter <http://jupyter.org>`_ website for more information about notebooks and consider watching this `youtube video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk>`_.
* See our `examples <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/auto_examples/index.html>`_ to get started on using and writing your own pycroscopy functions
* Videos and other tutorials are available at the `Institute For Functional Imaging of Materials <http://ifim.ornl.gov/resources.html>`_ 
* For more information about our functions and classes, please see our `API <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/pycroscopy.html>`_
* We have many translators that transform data from popular microscope data formats to pycroscopy compatible .h5 files. We also have `tutorials to get you started on importing your data to pycroscopy <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/auto_examples/tutorial_01_translator.html>`_. 
* Details regarding the defention, implementation, and guidelines for pycroscopy's `data format <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/Data_Format.html>`_ for `HDF5 <https://github.com/pycroscopy/pycroscopy/blob/master/docs/Pycroscopy_Data_Formatting.pdf>`_ are also available. 
* We can guide you to convert your file formats into pycroscopy compatible HDF5 files and help you get started with data analysis.
* We are interested in collaborating with industry members to integrate pycroscopy into instrumentation or analysis software.
* If you are interested in contributing and are looking for topics we are / will work on, please look at our `To Do <https://github.com/pycroscopy/pycroscopy/blob/master/ToDo.rst>`_ page
